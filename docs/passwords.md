# Passwords

Until a better harmonization, students need multiple passwords to use the school's different services. They are handled by the Bocal and the CRI.

## Bocal

They are given by the Bocal at the beginning of the scholarship, there are 4 of them :

 * password: to check one's emails and to connect to ionis-portal (wifi)
 * pwd_socks: to log on netsoul
 * pwd_ppp: to connect to the [Bocal intranet](http://intral.bocal.org)
 * pwd_num: for digicodes

For new accounts, created after 2016, only "password" is given.

## Epita

Only INFO-SPE or ING1/ING2 students are given this password. It serves purposes such as :

 * unix sessions on PXE
 * unix exams (spe/ing1)
 * ACU intranet
 * some workshops (thlr, alrorithms, etc...)
