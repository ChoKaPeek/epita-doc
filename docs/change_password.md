# Changing password

It is possible to change the *epita* [password](passwords.md).

## Password policy

The password must be as follow:

 *  At least 10 characters long
 *  Should have 3 different case (At least one uppercase character, one lower case, and one numerical character)

## Procedure

To change one's password, one has to be connected with his account on a computer in PXE mode. In a shell, type the `kpasswd` command (man kpasswd). kpasswd will ask for the current password two times, then two times for the new one.

## Forgetting password

In case of over-sighting a password, a re-initialization interface will be available. Until then, the student has to contact the assistants and will be punished.
