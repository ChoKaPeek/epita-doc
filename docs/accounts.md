# Accounts

Students at EPITA are given two kind of accounts: one is related with their
status as an IONIS student (Bocal Account), and another one is linked to EPITA
(CRI Account).


## Bocal

The Bocal account is created at the beginning of the scholarship, allowing
students to:

 * Check one's emails on [Office365](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)
 * Connect to Ionis Portal and IONIS (wifi)
 * Connect to the [Bocal intranet](http://console.bocal.org)

Your bocal password cannot be changed manually but it can be regenerated on the
[Bocal intranet](http://console.bocal.org/#/profile).

## Epita

Every EPITA student is given a CRI account. It serves purposes such as:

 * UNIX sessions on PXE
 * UNIX exams (SPÃ‰/ING)
 * CRI's intranet
 * Assistants' intranets
 * Some workshops (THLR, algorithms, etc...)
