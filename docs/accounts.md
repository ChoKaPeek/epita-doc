# Accounts

Students at EPITA are given two kind of accounts: one is related with their
status as an IONIS student (Bocal Account), and another one is linked to EPITA
(CRI Account).


## Bocal

The Bocal account is created at the beginning of the scholarship, allowing
students to:

 * Check one's emails on [Office365](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)
 * Connect to Ionis-Portal (wifi)
 * Connect to the [Bocal intranet](http://intra.bocal.org)

For new accounts, created after 2016, only "password" is given. However, for
previous accounts, 4 were given:

 * password: to check one's emails and to connect to ionis-portal (wifi)
 * pwd_socks: to log on netsoul
 * pwd_ppp: to connect to the [Bocal intranet](http://intra.bocal.org)
 * pwd_num: for digicodes (not used anymore)

## Epita

Every EPITA student is given a CRI account. It serves purposes such as :

 * UNIX sessions on PXE
 * UNIX exams (SPÃ‰/ING)
 * Assistants' intranets
 * Some workshops (THLR, algorithms, etc...)
