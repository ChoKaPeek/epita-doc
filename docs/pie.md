# IT Workstation

Computer rooms located at Villejuif or Le Kremlin-BicÃªtre are available at any time - day and night. There are two ways of accessing them:

 *  Use a rack / USB disk
 *  Network boot (Preboot Execution Environment, PXE)

## Rack / USB Disks

The school offers a basic "dump" with the necessary tools to follow courses. It is still allowed to modify it and install any application. However, it is up to the student's responsibility to ensure that the necessary tools are installed to follow courses given by the school.

If there is any problem, it is possible to [redump](redump.md) the disk.

## Network boot

It is also possible to boot computers directly from the network, without any hard drive.

Computers are supposedly already configured to boot this way if no disk is detected, it is still possible to force it by pressing the F12 key at boot.

A menu is then proposed with an [archlinux](archlinux_netboot.md) session.
